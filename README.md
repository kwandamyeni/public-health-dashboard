# 🩺 Public Health Dashboard – South Africa

This end-to-end project analyzes public health indicators across South Africa, showcasing disparities in healthcare access, disease burden, and vaccination coverage. The goal is to create a dynamic, multi-layered dashboard that turns raw health data into actionable insights—bridging data analysis, visualization, and strategic reporting.
